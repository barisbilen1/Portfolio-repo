How to use PDF Splitter?

## Setup:

1) Install Python from the internet (link:"https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/" --> you can choose windows 64-bit)
2) Place this "PdfSplitter" folder to your desktop (don't change its name)
3) Go to program_files in PdfSplitter and right-click run.bat, and choose "Edit with Notepad++".
    --> If you don't have Notepad++ installed on your system, "Edit with Notepad++" option will not appear.
4) Update the paths in this little script. First one is the path (location) for python, second one is the path for the script to be run.
    --> To retrieve the path of python, write "anaconda prompt" to search bar, open it, and write "print(sys.executable)" then press enter.
    --> You will see the path of python.exe. Enter this path to the first path mentioned in step 4.  
5) Make sure to save the above file with .bat extension (use "save as" option for this) (or create .txt file and make its extension .bat)
6) Write "Anaconda Prompt" to search bar at the very left bottom, open it.
7) Write "cd Desktop/PdfSplitter/program_files" and press enter.
8) Write pip install -r requirements.txt.

--> Installation is completed.

## Usage:

1) Press the 'PdfSplitter' icon and the program will guide you through the terminal.

A friendly warning: Always check the output. Program works pretty much stable but extra set of eyes would do no harm.
